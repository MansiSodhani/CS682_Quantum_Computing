# CS682_Quantum_Computing IITK
---
The assignments involve designing custom quantum circuits using basic quantum gates in Qiskit.

### Assignment 1:
-
Task 1: Create a swap circuit without utilizing the built-in swap function and verify the output for |0⟩|+⟩ using a state-vector simulator
-
Task 2: Create and simulate the entangled state (|01⟩+|10⟩)/√2 apply a CNOT with the second qubit as control, assess entanglement post-operation, and visualize results over 100 runs
-
Task 3: Design a circuit for x, y, z → x, y, z⊕(x⊕y)′ without direct x–z interaction and represent its action as a matrix.
---
### Assignment 2: 
-
Task 1: Implement the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm to determine whether f:{0,1}³ → {0, 1} f(x, y, z)=x⊕y⊕z′ is balanced or constant
-
Task 2: Design an efficient quantum circuit for half-adder and extend it to perform a custom ternary operation (x, y, z)→(x, t, x⊕y⊕z) where t = ((x⊕y)∧z)∨(x∧y)
